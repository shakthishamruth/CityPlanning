# VITMAS_CityPlanning (Unfinished)
Q.
Assume a city made of square grids (n X n). The gird is filled with three different types of infrastructure: 
1. Residential (plot as green) 
2. Commercial (plot as blue) 
3. Industrial (plot as yellow)

Assume the city to have 50 percent residential 30 percent commercial and 20 percent industrial. And it only fills about 70 percent of the entire land. (Approximate values you can choose your own values) 

•	Clumping of areas (it is preferable that we have a group of similar building to together… at the same time we need to ensure that we don’t just put the entire residential area into one clump)

•	Also, it is preferable to have industrial areas as far away residential ones 

•	Also, it is preferable to have commercial buildings near to residential buildings) 

•	Also, commercial areas should be scattered across the map.
