# VITMAS_CityPlanning


Generates a city map made of square grids (20 X 20). The gird is filled with three different types of infrastructure: 
1. Residential (plot as green) 
2. Commercial (plot as blue) 
3. Industrial (plot as yellow)

The city fills about 70 percent of the entire land out of which 50 percent is residential 30 percent is commercial and 20 percent is industrial.

•	Clumping of areas (it is preferable that we have a group of similar building to together… at the same time we need to ensure that we don’t just put the entire residential area into one clump)

•	Also, it is preferable to have industrial areas as far away residential ones 

•	Also, it is preferable to have commercial buildings near to residential buildings) 

•	Also, commercial areas should be scattered across the map.
